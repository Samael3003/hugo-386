##  >> Reason behind the Blog :- 

Many people ask me, how the linux works, what is linux and all kinds of he stuff, maybe related to functions, or also Linux, since I use Linux for my Daily Driving.

What may people do, is that they open Google or Firefox or Safari (Rich Dad Kids) and go on searching Linux Tutorial or I want to be a Hacker and this is what the normies do. And more they search, the go on falling into the crap of NET and finally buy courses on Udemy or Coursera , or whatever platform they like.

First of all, this is all a bunch of 8shit- Stupidity and nobody will get anything just by google-ing stuff, unil you use some bunch of TACTICS. If not, you will end up falling Prey for the Marketting Strategies of Udemy or whatever Garbage Content Producers.


##  >> For Linux :: 

For a really good content, you realy have to dig in, so that you may achieve better results. For eg. look at this website: https://linux.die.net/. So now, after having having better look at the website, what are the odds that you will end up on this particular website? very little or say minute right. Just look at the page, Drawn of the Simplicity, and as the saying goes, “All that Glitters is not Gold”, right? Really If I get any friend asking where do I start my linux Journey, I surely will recmmend this to him. Even still, in my 2-3 years of the Linux Experience, I am refering this document for my Journey.

The Info this Document provides, is out of the box, and so arcane, dont have words to express. For example, reading this page: https://linux.die.net/Intro-Linux/sect_04_01.html , I got to know how the P.S works. Many Linux-men may be dont know, on typing “**pstree**”, you may see the layout of the processes happening in the device, from the time of the Boot-Up. It shows the “**systemd**” process and the forking of the Processes that happen later on, like the network processes, and the Login Processes, which later start some other processes, and so on.

Document not only teaches you how the things work, but also other things like **Home-Sweet-Home** https://linux.die.net/Intro-Linux/chap_07.html which is a documentation to keep the storage folders and the devices clean, and stuff like making the directories, or other stuff like managing the directories, and all.

Other things were like the **“OSI MODEL”** https://linux.die.net/Intro-Linux/sect_10_01.html , which is the best way to understand the Networking, like start from scrap and then understanding the advanced part. (You know what, Fuck it, right now I am going crazy about this Heavenly Document.)

And there is the **System Administrators’ Guide:** https://linux.die.net/Intro-Linux/sect_10_01.html; which clears all the concepts regarding the Sys-Admin and the Administration of the overlying system and all th crappy stuff about this and that..


##  >> Fed up of the Normies :( 

Another thing is that the people want to surf the internet, just in the voyage of finding the tutorials. I dont understand why the people want someone other to explain them the stuff. I dont understand, you learnt about the Calculus in the School, passed the JEE examination, or other kind of Exam like CET or stuff to reach here. You put all the effort to achieve the results, then why should you let others explain you the childish concepts? and for that, buying the courses is not the option; cause I think, it is just another type of Spoon-Feeding done to an infant. The underlying Principle is just Reading the Document, and understanding how the Things are working inside the Kernel, cause, at the end of the Day, or in the Long Run, you have to do it, as it is a pretty handy tool.


## >> C-Programming

Another thing is the GNU Manual and is affiliated to **C-Programming**. Most people want to learn the C-Language. But they dont realise that this page: “https://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-c-manual/gnu-c-manual.html” contains everything related to C-Programming. Anytime I get struck with C-Programming, I refer this page, and

## >> C++ Programming

For the C++ Programming language, I always love refering to the **C++ Reference website**: “https://en.cppreference.com/w/”. You know what, I love this website. Whenever I do my competitive Programming, this is my GO-TO WEBSITE.

## >> BASH Scripting ...

This thing, the GNU Manual, also come for the **BASH SCRIPTING**. there is a pdf manual, but always go with the HTML manual : “https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html”, since it keeps updated iself, and moreover, it is the cleaner version than compared to the pdf version. And one mor thing, no video in world will teach you the techniques taught in this manual. It is self-explanatory manual; Just read it and you will be the **Bash-Mage.**


## >> More of what I feel .....

You know, reading the Reference pages is simple,like in the case of the **C++ Reference** and the **linux.die.net**, where you simply have to type the query you want to search. But, for the Reference manuals, like the **GNU Manuals** and the **Man-Pages**, you definitely need to have some skills. But, in the end of the Day, you definitely will learn to use them. You dont need to get afraiid of the Manuals, and rely on other tutors to teach stuff; whereas, your aim should be to become the self-taught Programmer or the Hacker you are ment to be. Start doing research; you are not any uneducated person. You are the one who has cracked JEE Examination and other CETs to get here. Even the Universe cant stop you from achieving what you wanted.

## >> CONCLUSION :)

This is just random stuff I am expressing about, but i think fining new resourses and Researching about them is the main principle or the Quality I must MASTER, at the end. Moreover, the Intellect does not matter in the world, but the **INNOVATION that we MUSTER**.

I just go on surfing the net, unti I find the tool that is right for the needs, and work on it to perfect myself. And i dont think that any Udemy Course or any other Youtube tutorial is/will be able to impart this much knowledge. Just practicing and polishing our Tools makes us Important.
